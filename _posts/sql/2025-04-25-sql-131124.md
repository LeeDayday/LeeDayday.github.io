### 정답
```sql
-- MEMBER_PROFILE: MEMBER_ID, MEMBER_NAME, TLNO, GENDER, DATE_OF_BIRTH
-- REST_REVIEW: REVIEW_ID, REST_ID, MEMBER_ID, REVIEW_SCORE, REVIEW_TEXT, REVIEW_DATE
WITH MOST_REVIEWS_MEMBER_ID AS (
    SELECT MEMBER_ID
    FROM REST_REVIEW
    GROUP BY MEMBER_ID
    ORDER BY COUNT(REVIEW_ID) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)

SELECT 
    M.MEMBER_NAME, 
    R.REVIEW_TEXT, 
    DATE_FORMAT(R.REVIEW_DATE, '%Y-%m-%d') AS REVIEW_DATE
FROM MEMBER_PROFILE AS M
JOIN MOST_REVIEWS_MEMBER_ID AS MID
    ON M.MEMBER_ID = MID.MEMBER_ID
JOIN REST_REVIEW AS R
    ON M.MEMBER_ID = R.MEMBER_ID
ORDER BY 3, 2;
```

#### ✅ Point
- 최다 리뷰 수의 멤버 아이디를 별도의 cte로 선언
   - 내림차순 정렬 후 limit 1 로 결과를 제한했기 때문에, 동점자에 대해선 처리 못 함
- 총 3개의 table을 join. 모두 member_id가 같은 경우를 기준으로 join

### 다른 풀이
- 동점자를 모두 반영하는 풀이
```sql
-- MEMBER_PROFILE: MEMBER_ID, MEMBER_NAME, TLNO, GENDER, DATE_OF_BIRTH
-- REST_REVIEW: REVIEW_ID, REST_ID, MEMBER_ID, REVIEW_SCORE, REVIEW_TEXT, REVIEW_DATE
WITH REVIEWS_CNT AS (
    SELECT MEMBER_ID, COUNT(REVIEW_ID) AS REVIEW_CNT
    FROM REST_REVIEW
    GROUP BY MEMBER_ID
),
    MAX_REVIEW_MEMBER_ID AS (
    SELECT MEMBER_ID
    FROM REVIEWS_CNT
    WHERE REVIEW_CNT = (
        SELECT MAX(REVIEW_CNT)
        FROM REVIEWS_CNT
    )
)


SELECT 
    M.MEMBER_NAME, 
    R.REVIEW_TEXT, 
    DATE_FORMAT(R.REVIEW_DATE, '%Y-%m-%d') AS REVIEW_DATE
FROM MEMBER_PROFILE AS M
JOIN MAX_REVIEW_MEMBER_ID AS MID
    ON M.MEMBER_ID = MID.MEMBER_ID
JOIN REST_REVIEW AS R
    ON M.MEMBER_ID = R.MEMBER_ID
ORDER BY 3, 2;
```
