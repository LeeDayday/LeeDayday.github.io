### 정답
```sql
SELECT V.customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits V
LEFT JOIN Transactions T
ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id
WHERE T.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY V.customer_id;
```

#### ✅ Point
- 이런 식의 문제 유형을 "NOT IN" 이라고 함
    - 방법 1: `NOT IN / EXISTS` 로 풀기
    - 방법 2: `LEFT JOIN + IS NULL` 로 풀기

- Order Of Execution
    - `FROM Visits` > `LEFT JOIN Transactions ~ ` > `WHERE ~ ` > `GROUP BY ~ ` > `SELECT ~`

### 다른 풀이
- NOT IN 으로 푼 풀이

```sql
SELECT V.customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits V
WHERE V.visit_id NOT IN (
    SELECT visit_id
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY visit_id
)
GROUP BY V.customer_id;
```
- Order Of Execution
    - `FROM Visits` > (`FROM Transactions` > `GROUP BY` ~ > `SELECT ~`) > `WHERE` > `GROUP BY` > `SELECT`
