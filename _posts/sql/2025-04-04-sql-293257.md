### 정답
```sql
-- FISH_INFO: ID, FISH_TYPE, LENGTH, TIME
-- FISH_NAME_INFO: FISH_TYPE, FISH_NAME

SELECT
    COUNT(F.ID) AS FISH_COUNT,
    N.FISH_NAME AS FISH_NAME
FROM FISH_INFO AS F
JOIN FISH_NAME_INFO AS N ON F.FISH_TYPE = N.FISH_TYPE
GROUP BY FISH_NAME
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

#### ✅ Point
- 종류별 개수 집계: GROUP BY FISH_NAME을 통해 물고기 종류별로 개수(COUNT)를 구함
