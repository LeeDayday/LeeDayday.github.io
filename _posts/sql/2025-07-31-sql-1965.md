### 정답
```sql
SELECT E.employee_id
FROM Employees E
LEFT JOIN Salaries S
ON E.employee_id = S.employee_id
WHERE S.employee_id IS NULL

UNION

SELECT S.employee_id
FROM Employees E
RIGHT JOIN Salaries S
ON E.employee_id = S.employee_id
WHERE E.employee_id IS NULL

ORDER BY employee_id
```

#### ✅ Point
- MySQL에선 FULL OUTER JOIN 을 지원하지 않음
- `LEFT JOIN + NULL` UNION `RIGHT JOIN + NULL` 으로 접근
- 마지막에 `ORDER BY`를 작성해 UNION 한 결과를 바탕으로 정렬 수행
